# Miguel's NeoVim Configuration

## Requirements

The following must be installed in the system in order for the config to work:

- [`neovim`](https://github.com/neovim/neovim)
- [`ripgrep`](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep)
- [`fd`](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd) (can be installed with npm `npm install -g fd-find`)
- [`node`](https://github.com/nodejs/node) (only for some language servers)
- [MesloLG Nerd Font](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/download/v3.2.1/Meslo.zip)

It would be best to install all of these with a package manager such as
Homebrew, but I've done the installation from source and tarballs before and
it works.
